To simulate the model and get a BER over SNR go to the __main__.py file and click run. You can tune the parameters in the main file as you wish.

If you want to see the plots you have to run `docker run -p 8888:8888 -v YOUR_PATH\ip-sionna\notebooks:/tf -d sionna-docker` and use the Jupyter Notebook on localhost:8888
